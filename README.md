<p>What is the regex used by the script to filter IP addresses?</p>
<strong>Answer: ^(127\.|169\.254\.)</strong>

<br><br>

<p>What is the DLL imported by the script to call keylogging APIs?</p>
<strong>Answer: user32.dll</strong>
<p>I inspected the Start-Keylogger function and found DllImport references to user32.dll on lines 99, 101, 103, and 105, which provide access to GetAsyncKeyState (line 119) for monitoring keystrokes.</p>

<p>How many seconds does the script wait before re-establishing a connection?</p>
<strong>Answer: 60</strong>
